# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Week-05 Further look into HTML elements
### 1. Summary

Week firve of MART-341 gave us a more indepth look into the different elements of HTML. The different HTML elements we covered this week were images, tables and forms.

HTML Elements covered this week;

**Images**-images are key aspects to webpages, they are used for visual represntation, aesthetic aspects, description and so much more. Tis week we learned how to attach an image to a webpage. This is done thorugh the use of the 'img src="image.jpg" tags. Images can be linked directly to a webpage or can be attached as a link, that will redirect you to another html.

**Tables**-tables are commonly used to represent data is an ordered manner, such as scores or databases.

**Form**-This week we spent the majority of our time discussing different forms elements. Form elements are used to collect data from users of a webpage, through the example of a questionnaire. Examples of form elements we covered are; password imput, drop down boxes, checked boxes, buttons, file uploads etc.

### Homework

The homework assignment this week was to create a new index.html webpage consisting of a made questionnnaire, at which we needed to incorporate a number fo different elements from the course content. I really enjoyed the assignment this week, as we played with the different elements and can visually see how they transfor th webpage.
My webpage consisted of 4 images and one external image. Additionally I used the form elements, checked box, drop down, button, password and textarea to create my questionnaire.

### Issues

An issue I faced this week, was linking my photos to my webpage, the image was not showing on my webpage when loaded. This due to the fact that I had forgotten to close one of my element tabs. I was able to resolve that issue by peering at other classmates work to undertsnad how they did it.
Another issue I am having is trying to remember all the different elements we have been introduced to for the past few weeks. To help with this, I have started to keep a writing list of all the different elements, so that I can refer to this rather than return to previous lessons.

### Future Disscussion

I am really enjoying working with Html and am looking forwrd to discovering more as the class goes on.
